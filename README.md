# esperf - Elasticsearch Stress Testing Tool 

`esperf` is a multi-thread program designed for measuring Elasticsearch cluster's search, aggregation and other request capacity.
It reads the query DSL from the standard input and performs HTTP requests as the request body to the specified URL.
It is also able to modify the query string with random numbers and random strings in each request.

Usage: `esperf [-d dictionary_file] [-r max_recurrence] [-t num_threads] [-X method] [-u user:password] url`
Options:
- `-d dictionary_file`: Newline delimited strings dictionary file 
- `-h`: Show this help
- `-r max_recurrence`: Number of recurrence HTTP requests per thread (default 10)
- `-t num_threads`: Number of threads to generate, not always a big number gives more pressure (default 5)
- `-u user:password`: Username and password for HTTP authentication 
- `-v`: Verbose outputs for debugging purpose
- `-X`: HTTP method to perform

## Command line usage examples

Simply retrieve the greeting message 50 times.

    $ ./esperf "http://localhost:9200"

Perform a match_all query 1000x3 times on all shards from 3 threads.

    $ echo '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}' | ./esperf -r 1000 -t 3 "http://localhost:9200/_search"

Perform range queries with randomly generated numbers.

    $ echo '{"query": {"range": {"my_length": {"gte": $RNUM}}}}' |  ./esperf -r 1000 -t 3 "http://localhost:9200/_search"

Perform term queries with randomly selected strings from the dictionary.
    
    $ echo '{"query": {"term": {"first_name": {"value": "$RDICT"}}}}' | ./esperf -r 1000 -t 3 -d ./names.txt "http://localhost:9200/_search?size=1"

Perform bulk insert requests.

    $ ./esperf -X PUT -r 1000 -t 3 -d ./names.txt "http://localhost:9200/test-index/test-type/_bulk" < bulk.txt
